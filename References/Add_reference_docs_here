this is the latest code for our project,   it is made out of intents and html javascript codes.
though it is completely different from our original code, in that the chatbot is completely made out of predetermined inputs and responses. But it is highly trained and gives 
the correct response to your query.
I am facing one big problem in this project. Though I am able to display the text, like reports and matrix,   I am not able to display the images like the plots and corr matrix.
I hope you guys help me in that , I am attaching the chat and home html files please include them in the templates folder  as well as intent file add them in the colab temporary store.  Please help me with the completing our project.

Regards,
Poojan

this is the latest version of the project upload the new intents file and chat file in the temporary store.
you would see that it is displaying the regression and classification algorithms separately , I have not included image processing and NLP as my GPU has been disabled.
I again need help with image uploading and stopping ngrok server after everything is complete.
